**Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Justin. I'm a Principal Web Engineer, Technical Lead and educator.**

![Cerebrl's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=cerebrl)

I'm currently working as a Principal Engineer on ForgeRock's open source, Web projects for Identity and Access Management (IAM) development. Our main focus is on building a better developer experience for all ForgeRock customers and their developers. This entails both the design and development of SDKs, frameworks, and libraries as well as the development of educational tools, tutorials, and documentation.

## Current Projects

- [ForgeRock Web Login Framework](https://github.com/ForgeRock/forgerock-web-login-framework)
- [ForgeRock JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/ForgeRock/forgerock-javascript-sdk)
- [ForgeRock Token Vault SDK Plugin](https://github.com/ForgeRock/forgerock-javascript-sdk/packages/token-vault)
- [ForgeRock AM Script Manager](https://github.com/cerebrl/forgerock-am-script-manager)

An interesting project I'd like to call out is ForgeRock's Web Login Framework that just released 1.0. This project offers ForgeRock customers the ability to customize and generate embeddable JavaScript widgets or stand-alone applications for authenticating their users without having to build their own UIs or state management. You can [read more about it on the README.md from the repo](https://github.com/ForgeRock/forgerock-web-login-framework#forgerock-web-login-framework).

Another interesting project that I recently completed was an implementation of service workers, iframes and alternative origins to increase the security of stored access artifacts, inspired by a patent that ForgeRock owns. You can [read more about the experiment on the README.md within the prototype repo](https://github.com/cerebrl/sw-iframe-prototype).
