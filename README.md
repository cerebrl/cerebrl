**Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Justin. I'm a Principal Web Engineer, Technical Lead and educator.**

## Summary

I'm currently working as the lead engineer on ForgeRock's open source, Web projects. Our main focus is on building a better developer experience for all ForgeRock's customers and their developers. This entails both the design and development of SDKs, frameworks, and libraries as well as the development of educational tools, tutorials, and documentation.

## Projects

- [ForgeRock Javascript SDK](https://github.com/ForgeRock/forgerock-javascript-sdk)
- [ForgeRock Web Login Framework](https://github.com/cerebrl/forgerock-web-login-framework)
- [ForgeRock AM Script Manager](https://github.com/cerebrl/forgerock-am-script-manager)

An interesting project I'd like to call out is ForgeRock's Web Login Framework that's currently under heavy development. This project will offer ForgeRock customers the ability to customize and generate embeddable JavaScript widgets or stand-alone applications for authenticating their users without having to build their own UIs or state management. You can [read more about it on the README.md from the repo](https://github.com/cerebrl/forgerock-web-login-framework#forgerock-web-login-framework).

An interesting R&D initiative that I recently completed was a prototype implementation of the use of service workers, iframes and alternative origins to increase the security of stored access artifacts. You can [read more about the experiment on the README.md within the repo](https://github.com/cerebrl/sw-iframe-prototype).
